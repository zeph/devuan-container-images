Devuan GNU+Linux is a fork of Debian without `systemd` that allows
users to reclaim control over their system by avoiding unnecessary
entanglements and ensuring [Init Freedom][IF].

The `devuan/migrated` container images are built starting from their
corresponding `debian:<release>-slim` image, replacing the Debian APT
sources with sources appropriate for Devuan and doing an upgrade.  To
see the details of what has been done, see the `/tmp/migrate.sh` file
included in the image.

These images are used to build the [`devuan/devuan`][DD] images.

# Available Tags

Tags for all maintained [Devuan releases][DR] are available.  These
`<release>-slim` tags point to the most recently published image for a
release.  The corresponing suite names can be used as tags as well,
e.g. `testing-slim`.

Release and suite name tags move to a *different* image every time
updated images are made available.  To help you stay on a specific
version of an image, timestamped tags for each release are provided
(in `<release>-slim-YYYY-MM-DD` format) as well.

Finally, the `slim` tag is an alias for `stable-slim`.

Summarizing this by means of an example, for `ceres` the following
tags are available:

- `ceres-slim-YYYY-MM-DD` formatted tags for all published images
  built for the `ceres` release
- a `ceres-slim` tag that points to the `ceres-slim-YYYY-MM-DD` image
  that was most recently published
- an `unstable-slim` tag that aliases `ceres-slim`

# Getting Help

For questions specific to these images, please ask around on the
[DNG mailing list][ML].

# Development

These images are maintained at the [container-images][CI] project.
All code to build images and any issues pertaining to them can be
found there.  New issues can be submitted there as well.
